# Task Management System

A Django-based task management system with Docker orchestration, Celery background tasks, and PostgreSQL database.

## What I Built

This is a junior-level technical test project. I focused on getting the core functionality working rather than making everything perfect.

### API Features
The API endpoints let you do full CRUD operations on tasks:
- Create, edit, delete, and list tasks
- Search and filter tasks by different criteria
- Pagination for large task lists
- JWT authentication for secure access
- User registration, login, and logout

During development, I tested most of these by manually changing URLs and using the ModHeader Chrome extension to set JWT tokens in the headers.

### Frontend Features
The basic UI allows users to:
- Register new accounts
- Log in and log out
- View all tasks
- Add new tasks

It's not fancy, but it works and connects to the API properly.

### Technical Setup
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with persistent data storage
- **Background Tasks**: Celery for automated task processing
- **Caching**: Redis for session management and Celery broker
- **Docker**: Everything runs with a single `docker-compose up` command

## Quick Start
```bash
git clone <repo>
cd task-management-system
cp .env.sample .env
docker-compose up
```

Access the application at http://localhost:8000

## Default parameters
You can customize names of your database, ports, passwords and credentials inside `.env` file.
Admin credentials by default:
- Username: admin
- Password: adminpass


## Development Notes
This project has been a real challenge and a great learning experience. Iâ€™ve pushed my limits and got to know much more about the Django stack and what it takes to build a full stack application from scratch. I constantly had to look up resources and learn on the go, but practice is what makes you improve, and I know the real learning will come from repeating this process again and again.
Main focus was on getting the mandatory requirements, so time managament was crucial in this project.
